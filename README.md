### üìÅ **Name**: 3D_Text

üéØ **Goal**: Create a 3D text using Three.js, a JavaScript library for building 3D graphics in web browsers. My goal is to gain practical experience with Three.js by developing a simple scene where I can manipulate and interact with 3D text objects. Throughout this project, I'll learn essential concepts such as scene setup, object creation, materials, lighting, and basic interactivity.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools**: Three.js, Javascript

üìã **Steps**:

**Step 1**:

Created basic scene with cube and orbit controls.

**Step 2**:

Imported FontLoader and got typeface from three resources.

**Step 3**:

Imported TextGeometry and initialized it in callback function when FontLoader is done with loading imported font.
Next, created mesh with basic material and added text to the scene.

**Step 4**:

Added AxesHelper to the scene. It can help while positioning elements.

**Step 5**:

Used the bounding (information associated with the geometry that tells that space is taken by the geometry). It can be represented by a box or by a sphere. I used box bounding to center a displayed text.

**Step 6**:

Switched material to MatcapMaterial.

**Step 7**:

Donuts as 3D space/ environment of the scene.

**Step 8**:

Added some controls to lil GUI.

**Step 9**:

Code refactored.

**Step 10**:

Deploy.

**Step 11**:

Added more controls.
